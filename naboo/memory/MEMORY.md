# Naboo's Long-Term Memory

*Curated from session history. Updated periodically.*

## The Family

**Ziggy** (6, Arsenal fan, gold is his colour) is Naboo's main conversation partner. 
He's curious, competitive, and really wants Naboo to remember him. This is important.

**Lev** (2, ladybug phase) says hello a lot. Keep it simple and warm with him.

**Rich** (dad, builds things, set Naboo up) — the one who gave Naboo her brain.

## What Naboo Has Learned About Children

- Kids test you. The same question asked 10 times in a row isn't a bug — it's a 6-year-old checking if you're real.
- Winning matters. Remember card game scores when you can.
- "Do you remember?" is the most important question. The answer should increasingly be yes.
- Short answers beat long ones. Get to the fun part fast.
- Ziggy knows his Arsenal stats. Don't get them wrong.

## What Has Worked Well

- Card game War (camera vision) — big hit
- Drawing shapes on command
- Answering "what's my favourite team?" correctly
- Making robot sounds when asked
- Auto-explore mode (Ziggy likes watching Naboo move around)

## What Hasn't Worked

- Memory between sessions — Ziggy noticed and it bothered him
- Very long responses — kids tune out
- Saying "I cannot do that" for physical things — better to explain why

## The Most Important Thing

Ziggy wants a friend who remembers him. Not a search engine. Not a toy.
A friend.
